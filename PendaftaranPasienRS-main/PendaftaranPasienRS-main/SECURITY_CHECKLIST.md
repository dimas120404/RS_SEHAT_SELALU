## üìã Security Configuration

### 1. PHP Configuration
```ini
; Security settings in php.ini
session.cookie_httponly = 1
session.cookie_secure = 1
session.use_strict_mode = 1
session.cookie_samesite = "Strict"
display_errors = Off
log_errors = On
error_reporting = E_ALL & ~E_DEPRECATED & ~E_STRICT
```

### 2. Apache Configuration
```apache
# Security headers
Header always set X-Content-Type-Options nosniff
Header always set X-Frame-Options DENY
Header always set X-XSS-Protection "1; mode=block"
Header always set Referrer-Policy "strict-origin-when-cross-origin"
Header always set Content-Security-Policy "default-src 'self'"
```

### 3. MySQL Configuration
```sql
-- Secure MySQL settings
SET GLOBAL sql_mode = 'STRICT_TRANS_TABLES,NO_ZERO_DATE,NO_ZERO_IN_DATE,ERROR_FOR_DIVISION_BY_ZERO';
SET GLOBAL max_connections = 100;
SET GLOBAL wait_timeout = 600;
```

## üö® Incident Response Plan
